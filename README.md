I'm a software developer who is passionate about UI engineering and performance and constantly educating myself on maintainability and scalability design patterns which allow software teams to delivery high quality features in an efficient manner. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, NoeJS, Rust and GraphQL. I also enjoy writing technical blog posts and have several posts featured in well-known publications.
